🚀 **Who am I?**

I'm a passionate DevOps Engineer who loves building automated, scalable, and resilient cloud platforms. I thrive at the intersection of development and operations—transforming manual tasks into robust, repeatable systems using Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD, and containerization.  

My approach is shaped by hands-on experience across Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud, as well as real-world automation with tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes. I'm especially proud to be both a [HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/1e1a3d14-e9ab-45e2-9100-3216b4f46ee9) and a [Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer (ACE)](https://www.credly.com/badges/0c253dc5-210f-479a-a3f1-86e216464358/public_url).

🛠️ **What do I do best?**

- **Cloud Engineering**: Deploying and managing scalable, secure, and cost-effective infrastructure in Azure, AWS, and GCP.
- **Automation & IaC**: Building reproducible environments with Terraform and Ansible—no more snowflake servers!
- **CI/CD**: Designing pipelines with Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and ArgoCD for fast, safe, and reliable deployments.
- **Containerization**: Running modern applications with Docker and Kubernetes, including GitOps workflows and Helm-powered releases.
- **Observability**: Setting up monitoring, logging, and alerting with Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, and more for reliability and quick incident response.
- **Collaboration**: Bridging development and operations with strong communication, teamwork, and a drive to empower others.

---

🎯 **My Focus & Values**

- Always learning—cloud evolves fast, and so do I!
- Automate everything—so teams can focus on building, not babysitting servers.
- Security and reliability first—every system deserves to be robust and safe.
- Sharing knowledge and mentoring others—DevOps is a team sport.
